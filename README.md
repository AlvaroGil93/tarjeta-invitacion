## 📄 Description

This project involves creating a **wedding invitation card** using **HTML5** and **CSS3**. The goal of this project is to simulate a real-life scenario where a visually appealing and functional invitation is designed.

The design follows modern web practices, using **semantic HTML** to structure the content and **CSS** to achieve an attractive appearance. Special attention was given to typography, spacing, and using pastel colors to create a soft, elegant, and harmonious aesthetic. Media queries were implemented to ensure the invitation is responsive across different devices.
